A work in progress repository containing solutions
to the real-word-haskell book sorted by chapter.
http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/.

Each directory is a chapter and contains all the
exercises for a given chapter. The directory may
also contain some the the examples from that
chapter.

Some directories contain makefiles. Running ``make``
in these directories should build and run the example
program or the solution program to an exercise.

Other directories just contain haskell sources. These
haskell source can be loaded directly into a ghci
session using ``:l file.hs``. Also, such files should
contain instructional comments at the top on how to
load them.

Make sure that you have ghc(for the earlier chapters)
and cabal installed(for the later chapters).
