The source files that go along with the open book
http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/.

Some directories contain makefiles. Running ``make``
should build and run the example program or the
solution program to an exercise.

Other directories just contain haskell sources. These
haskell source can be loaded directly into a ghci
session using ``:l file.hs``. Also, such files should
contain instructional comments at the top on how to
load them.

Make sure that you have ghc(for the earlier chapters)
and cabal installed(for the later chapters).
