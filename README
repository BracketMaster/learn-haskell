The source files that go along with the open book
[Real World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/).

Each directory should contain a makefile, and thus,
running make in each chapter-directory should build
the the work for that chapter and execute it.

Make sure that you have ghc(for the earlier chapters)
and cabal installed(for the later chapters).
